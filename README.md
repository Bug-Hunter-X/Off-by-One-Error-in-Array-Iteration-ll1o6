This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array.  The original code attempts to access an index beyond the array bounds, leading to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The solution corrects the loop condition to prevent this error.  This simple example highlights the importance of careful array index management in Java programming.
